# Boogle-Throw
this is not Google Keep

this is what Google wished they had lol, jk i wanna clone the whole app. put some features of my own to differentiate Throw from Keep

for now im using basic vanilla stuff, need to add containers to store the user data. i wanna include a database that will hold on to the words from my users
as of now its running fully on localstorage.set and get

after adding containers, i need some functionality when interacting with the containers. 

unique features that i need to bring in: 
    customisation - the user can change modes and add theme colours
    unlimited space (provisional) - right now nobody is stopping you from putting any amount of data in to the app
    feedback - i can listen to your issues and try my best to fix it. 

future features to push() :
                database integration
                better ui
                image integration
                add bg customisation
